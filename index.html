    <p>
      Hey, I'm a Front-end Developer, UX Designer, Speaker as often as I can, and Consultant every now and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      I craft web applications for a living and for fun, getting envolved in nice Open-Source projects and  interesting people passionate about the web.

  <!--
  I strongly believe that Web Design is about User Experience, to craft a good experience means to provide a feeling of success to your user, therefore I'm more interested in techniques that help me (directly or not) to achieve this goal in all my projects.

      <p>
      And amongst my biggest interests is Responsive Web Design, take a look at my newest project: <a href="" target="_blank">BrowserFit</a>, hopefully you'll get interested on participating! =)
