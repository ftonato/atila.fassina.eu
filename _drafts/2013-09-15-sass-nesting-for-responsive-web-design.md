I've already written about my idea of and ideal workflow for RWD, so here's how it's been working for me the past couple of weeks and what I'm expecting for the future of responsive styles.

We still don't have a way of specifying specific media queries for each element by pseudo-classes. If I made you curious on that one, head over to [Jonathan Neal's post](http://www.jonathantneal.com/blog/thoughts-on-media-queries-for-elements/). I can wait, but come back, please. =P

So, since we can't do that yet (and probably won't be doing so soon), SASS fell beuatifully into my workflow, saving me a lot of time, effort and organizing my code. How, you may ask (and that's the point of this article..hehe).
