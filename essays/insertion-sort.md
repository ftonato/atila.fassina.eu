Itâ€˜s a simple to implement sort algorithm, not very efficient for large data sets, but quite efficiente and powerful for small ones. It can avoid confusion by not changing the order of equal set of keys. In a nutshell, Insertion Sort iterates twice through the array. First iteration corresponds to the target position, whilst second iteration is for comparison with future elements. Every time the current item is smaller than the comparison value, it is inserted in the current position and first iteration moves forward.
