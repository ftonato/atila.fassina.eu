It really pisses me off when someone evaluate a design based on aestethics, that's actually just part of the job. Designing is about solving problems, not shallow aestethic problems, but usability, accesibility, functionality problems. In our case, web design is for making information and/or interaction smoother and clearer.

##Form follows function
I chose the Bauhaus Dessau building as this post picture because of Bauhaus Movement basic tenet. In Web Design, "form follows function" can be translated to "content informs layout". It states that a product (being it a website or piece of furniture) must strive to functionality and its form and shape will go along.


##Good design is invisible
This is a very misdirected concept, people use it to judge looks, saying that a nice design should't be visible just because you want a flat-minimalistic-**[[insert trendy concept here]]** is very misguided. For a design to be truly invisible it needs to be organized and displayed as if users don't need to ask for its solutions, they just have it.

##Design is about Content Strategy
Users go to a website for information. It may be a visual guide, a text, a list of related topics, photo gallery,...

I don't know what kind of information your site contains, but that's what users want. And to have a good design means that you're displaying that information in a intuitive, easily conducted way. A good design will point the most relevant, or most important, piece of information to your user, it will guide him throught what you want him to see without letting him feel hijacked of his initial purpose. That's the true beauty of a design.

##TL;DR

Design is not about looking good. Design is about providing nice experiences by delivering what the users really want, a.k.a **display content in the best way possible**. Looking good is a plus-point of an excellent design, not its main purpose.

ProTip: Before wanting to look astonishing, solve any content issues you might have.
