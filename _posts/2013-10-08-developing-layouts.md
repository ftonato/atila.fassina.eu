The web is confused. I've seen discussions and articles from great people trying to get a [job title naming convension](http://css-tricks.com/job-titles-in-the-web-industry/), or specifying what would be the [role of a Front-end Developer](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/development-is-design/). And I'm really glad great people like [Brad Frost](https://twitter.com/brad_frost) and [Chris Coyer](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier) have done that.

But, even though it's awesome that **we** know exactly our job attributions (and I bevlieve we do), people around us must also realise what **they** are supposed to pass on to us.

I've been working as a Frontender for a couple of years now, and I stumbled on some different kinds of UI Designers. And I divide them in some nice (maybe not...) categories:

- *Web Printers:* They're those who hate code and think that their job is making a 'print-like' layout that they think is suitable and assure that developers **obey** their rules.

- *Code Friendly:* These were Web Designers back then, but code started to get too complex and they focused on UI. They usually understand and respect the web standards and like to have someone else taking care of "coding the layouts".

- *Visual Designers:* the future-friendly ones. For me, they're the ideal UI Designers to work with. They have a superficial knowledge of web standards but are always open to information. They recognize that their nice layouts are not the final product and are not extremists when it comes to a few tweaks for code improvement. Usually they care a lot for User Experience and like to discuss the best solutions with an UX Designer or/and a Front-end Developer.

I really believe there's room for everybody that's willing to study and focus on a role. The web is big enough already and is still growing, so if you don't try to swallow it all, you'll do great and find other interesting and hardworking people.

Just remember, by the end of the day:
>We sell **code**, not **PSD**s. *[-Harry Roberts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldx4ZFxMEeo)*

Web is collective, which means there's room for UI, UX, Front-end, Back-end, Full Stack, etcâ€¦ It doesn't matter exactly what you do if you do it well and let others participate.

Don't be greedy and you'll be more than fine.
