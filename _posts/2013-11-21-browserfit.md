Responsive Web Design[RWD] has been one of the hottest topics on web development, not surprisingly more companies have tunned their workflow to enhance the power of their applications with RWD best practices. To make your layout responsive is more than adapt it to different viewport sizes, there's a concern with user experince that has to reach the foundations of development, otherwise the product may lose its usage.

Therefore, whilst it's trendy topic, because of plurarity of devices RWD can be overwhelming and scaring at a first glance.

##Step back, take a deep breath.

Yes, work with RWD means that you're accepting the responsability of making your app work in all those devices and on [those not yet invented](http://futurefriend.ly/).

##How to start.

A common mistake of those willing to start with RWD is beginning by the code. Redimension and re-styling your elements is just part of the work and easily becomes pointless by itself.

Actually, we really should have code by the beginning of the process. [But not escorted by a full composition PSD](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/the-post-psd-era/). Design areas of content with real content in mind and let the application take shape already inside its enviornment (a.k.a, the browser). There are several techniques that help you throught this process, and [BrowserFit](http://browserfit.github.io) is going to help you choose which will suit best **your** workflow. And kickstart your brainstorm with a Content and Mobile first mind.

##Good code is maintainable code.

Legacy stylesheet can be a real pain. To estabilsh a consistent way of writing and making your styles meaningful (either by architecture, semantic, or code structure) is very important, but usually let aside.

>Code as if the next developer is psycopath who knows where you live.

That genius quote (whose author I forgot, sorry) should probably be the mantra of every developer. [BrowserFit](http://browserfit.github.io) will quickly walks you throught different and smart methodologies of style writing to let you choose which to follow, or make your own up.

##Media Queries

Probably the most important styling tool of RWD. Media Queries let you listen to some important characteristics your user's device has and to respond to it (**respon**sive rings a bell, right?!?Sorry, couldn't miss the hook...hehe). But there's many ways of writing it, specially with CSS preprocessors like SASS, Stylus and LESS. So, [BrowserFit](http://browserfit.github.io) runs throught those techniques with you and let's you incorporate them to your utility belt.

##Oh yeah, preprocessors are also important...
In [BrowserFit showcase](https://github.com/browserfit) you can contribute and find some snippets and tips that may help you choose which one you'll use, or even power-up your coding! (feed the showcase with your experiments too!)

##And much more...
And we've only just begun (there's an 80's song for that, right?!). Seriously, RWD is a topic so broad that can relate to basicly any topic regarding web development. So, if you have an idea, throw it there and share it... actually, that's the real point behind all of these. Share.

##Just one more thing...
Talking about sharing, don't forget to visit [This-is-Responsive](http://bradfrost.github.io/this-is-responsive/), something like a hub gathering news, tutorials, articles about RWD. If you find something nice there, digest it... put your thinking on it, and right on [BrowserFit](http://browserfit.github.io) ;)

##TL;DR. <small>(Too long. Didn't Read it.)</small>
BrowserFit is a tool to help you kickstart your RWD Workflow guiding you throught best practices with simple steps and helping you ask the right questions at the right time.

Also, it has a [Github repositories showcase](https://github.com/browserfit) for techniques, tools and features that may help you level up your game.

It is by the community and for the community.
