This project was made together with Visual Desginer (and wonderful wife, BTW) [Natalia Lassance](http://behance.net/natalialassance) and is currently online at [www.efeitosolucoes.com.br](http://www.efeitosolucoes.com.br). Natalia and I were already in delivering-stage of another project, so it wasn't our first as a team. What made this one very special was the agreement we had on leveling up our workflow sync. After having some setbacks on the previous project that led us to a lot of do-overs and debating hours, we were aiming to boost up our productivity.

First of all, we blurred a lot the line between her work and mine. Theoretically, as the UI Designer, she would still be the one in charge of layout, and I, as the Front-end Developer, would still be the code guy. However, during our brainstorming proccess and even along the developing phases, we talked and argued a lot about the best solutions for this project. And, as I said before, the threshold was blurred, which led us to not having none of us calling the shots on UX Design, it was 50%/50% actually.

Regarding to the workflow, UI and UX this project was -no doubt- the one I could learn the most. And even about the code, it was very challenging, since we got into an "excel vibe", we were both researching and figuring out different ways of creating innovative and nice ways of implementing the client's idea.

It was right on time that we decided for that approach, because this project already had some peculiarities in which our new workflow perspective would fit perfectly.

> You do not talk about Fight Club

[Efeito Soluções](http://www.efeitosolucoes.com.br) is a company advisor and carreer counseling company. That been said, most -if not all- of their clients are sigilous. So, we had in our hands this big company, with very talented people and very respective clients but we could not talk about it! Actually, we could talk about the talented people, but their clients were forbidden subject.

####Tradition && Innovation####

These were the foundations of their desires regarding the website. We were suppose to estabilish this 'traditional' feeling without letting out their traditional clients and cases. Also, we had this 'innovation' goal to set a landmark between them and the rest of the market. Align this traditional approach and the innovation was a bit of a challenge, specially regarding User Interactions. It was a point of honor that navigation would be cutting edge at the time, but it had to remain intuitive to non-'digital-native' people.

####At ease with the limitations. Let's get it done####

After a couple of tests with too innovative navigation, we decided we had to get that traditional, common, well learned navigation pattern and spice it up a notch. We did that with giving another look to the scrollbar, hiding the logo while scrolling down with a fake-parallax, and having a scrollspy pin-pointing where the user were throught the page. Also, we manage to explain to the client the advantages of a infinite-scroll navigation and how we were making all the info available to the user in a 'single-click' way, all because they had this very high range of services, possibilities and target-clients we decided to pass to the user the steering wheel right from start.

####New portfolios, new approaches####

Did I mention that the company was in a remodeling proccess since two of the three partners were finishing their PhDs? Well, yeah. Right after we had our briefing meeting, they entered a very steep growing curve. So, when we got to show-&-deliever stage they were starting to have a very nice response from that hardwork, this led us to some adjustments on the website to accomodate this new information and positioning. From whole sections to minor tweakings, we re-thought a big piece of the work.

####The rainbow in the end####

I reckon that it compensated enourmesly now. After that long proccess since the meeting, structuring the possibilities and some paralell advising (not mentioned here to prevent subject deriving) I learned more than a could describe in this project, from client-dealing throught all the proccess it was very awesome to have all these non-predicted changes and news.
