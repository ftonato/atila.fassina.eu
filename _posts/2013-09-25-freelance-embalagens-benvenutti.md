This is project for a local package retailer, it was my first freelance (as a matter of fact, it was my first project ever) and its intention wasn't to be responsive (at least not according to the client expectations) and it is supposed to be a first contact with most of the clients. This website was put online for the first time in June, 2012.

For this particular project I was in charge of pretty much everything, since there was no back-end.I was coding (HTML, CSS and JS -at the time with lots of jQuery) and layouting. So, regarding the workflow I was pretty free, so it was decided to pre-approve the first layout with a PSD and start from there with coding, the client still had some sayings in the beginning of the coding proccess, which led me to some extra-work but I do not regret because it was fun to layout while experimenting some intended features (it was pre-agreed with them that we would take an experimental approach in this early beginning).

Embalagens Benvenutti managers contacted me to come up with an aesthetic ideal that would go along their new idea for the company (recently it had gone throught major management changes). They war prospecting a lot of new clients and were missing a link between their company (which is far from downtown) and their customers. They also needed a on-line portfolio, in case their soon-to-become clients contacted and wanted to see their products.

Since the company was still working their way up again (after that big remodeling), this layout considered the lack of ready-to-publish material would be ready with minimum amount of information, prepared to expand as the company grow and new information be required to publishing.

Considering the fact that it was a small company and still at re-starting point with its business, there was not so much to do about ``SEO`` at the time, there were some On-Page optimization, but no further attention was given to that. As for ``cross-browser`` support, the site perfeclty supports IE9+.
